## ðŸ”¹ AWS Provider Configuration (`aws-provider-config.tf`)

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"   # Set your preferred AWS region
}

# Example: Create a simple IAM user
resource "aws_iam_user" "testuser" {
  name = "testuser"
}
Notes:

The provider block defines which AWS region Terraform will deploy resources to.

You can authenticate using:

AWS access key & secret key (not recommended for production)

AWS IAM Role with Assume Role (recommended for security)
